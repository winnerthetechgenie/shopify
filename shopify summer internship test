#for a shoe to be relatively affordable and having an AOV of $3145.13 signifies that there is an error in the calculation
#taking note of the fact that Average Order Value (AOV) is a metric that measures the average total of every order placed 
# with a merchant over a defined period of time. 

#so how was the value ($3145.14) gotten?

#AOV is calculated with the formula AOV= Total Amount/Total number of item sold
